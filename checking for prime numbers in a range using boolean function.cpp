Program description:- 

A prime number is a natural number with only two factors:- 1 and the number itself.
Or we canâ€™t have two numbers smaller than that numbers with a multiplication equal to that number itself.

#) Algorithm to use ::

1) Get the start and the end number from the user.

2) Check for each number if it is a prime or not.

3) If a number is prime, print it.

Use the below steps to check if a number is prime or not. We are using one separate function to do the prime check. This function returns one boolean value:- 

a) The first prime number is 2. If the number is less than 2, return false. 

b) Run one loop starting from 2 to (number/2). If any number in this range can divide the number, return false i.e. this number is not a prime.

c) If no number is found that can divide the number, this number is a prime number and return true for that.
